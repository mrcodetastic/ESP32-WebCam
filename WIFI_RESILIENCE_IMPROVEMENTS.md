# WiFi Resilience Improvements for ESP32-WebCam

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to make the ESP32-WebCam project more resilient to WiFi network outages and connectivity issues.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **WiFi Connection Only Checked at Startup**
- **Problem**: The original code only established WiFi connection during `setup()` and never checked connectivity status during runtime.
- **Solution**: Added periodic WiFi status checking every 30 seconds in the main loop.

### 2. **No Recovery Mechanism**
- **Problem**: When WiFi disconnected, the device would continue attempting uploads without trying to reconnect.
- **Solution**: Implemented automatic reconnection mechanism using AutoConnect portal.

### 3. **HTTP Uploads Without Connectivity Verification**
- **Problem**: `uploadPhoto()` function attempted HTTP connections without verifying WiFi status.
- **Solution**: Added WiFi connectivity checks before and during HTTP operations.

### 4. **Poor Error Handling**
- **Problem**: Limited error handling for network issues during photo transmission.
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive error checking and graceful failure handling.

## New Features Added

### WiFi Management Functions
- `checkWiFiConnection()`: Verifies current WiFi status
- `reconnectWiFi()`: Handles automatic reconnection with retry logic

### Enhanced Monitoring
- **LED Status Indicators**: 
  - Blinking: WiFi connected and functioning
  - Solid red: WiFi disconnected
  - Fast blink: Currently streaming
- **Telnet Commands**: Added new commands for WiFi management and debugging

### Configuration Options (config.h)
```cpp
const unsigned long wifiCheckInterval = 30000;     // Check WiFi every 30 seconds
const unsigned long wifiReconnectInterval = 30000; // Wait between reconnection attempts
const int maxReconnectAttempts = 10;               // Max attempts before restart
```

### New Telnet Commands
- `wifi` - Show detailed WiFi connection status and signal strength
- `reconnect` - Force WiFi reconnection attempt
- `help` - Display all available commands

### Safety Features
- **Watchdog Timer**: 60-second timeout to prevent system hangs
- **Graceful Degradation**: Skips photo uploads when WiFi unavailable rather than hanging
- **Progressive Recovery**: Multiple reconnection attempts before system restart

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Periodic WiFi Status Checking
```cpp
// In main loop - checks every 30 seconds
if (currentMillis - lastWiFiCheckMillis >= wifiCheckInterval) {
    if (!checkWiFiConnection()) {
        reconnectWiFi();
    }
    lastWiFiCheckMillis = currentMillis;
}
```

### 2. Upload Protection
```cpp
// Check WiFi before upload
if (!checkWiFiConnection()) {
    Serial.println("WiFi not connected. Skipping photo upload.");
    return false;
}

// Double-check during upload preparation
if (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    Serial.println("WiFi disconnected during upload preparation.");
    return false;
}
```

### 3. Transmission Monitoring
```cpp
// Check WiFi status during data transmission
if (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    Serial.println("WiFi connection lost during photo upload!");
    client.stop();
    return false;
}
```

### 4. Smart Reconnection Logic
- Uses AutoConnect portal for credential management
- Implements exponential backoff between attempts
- Automatic system restart after multiple failed attempts
- Preserves reconnection attempt counter for debugging

## Benefits

1. **Improved Reliability**: Device continues operating even with intermittent WiFi
2. **Self-Healing**: Automatic recovery from network outages
3. **Better Monitoring**: Enhanced status reporting and debugging capabilities
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Continues camera operations when network unavailable
5. **Reduced Maintenance**: Automatic recovery reduces need for manual intervention

## Usage Notes

- Device will automatically attempt to reconnect when WiFi is lost
- Photo uploads are skipped (not queued) when WiFi unavailable
- Red LED provides visual indication of WiFi status
- Telnet interface allows remote monitoring and control
- System automatically restarts after 10 consecutive failed reconnection attempts

## Monitoring and Debugging

Use the telnet interface to monitor WiFi status:
```
telnet <ESP32_IP_ADDRESS>
> wifi          # Check WiFi status and signal strength
> status        # Camera and upload status
> reconnect     # Force reconnection attempt
> help          # Show all commands
```

The enhanced LED indicators provide immediate visual feedback about system status without requiring network access.
